'Cash-Karp adaptive ODE solver.
'
'This subroutine solves ODE  Y'=f(Y,x)  with  initial  conditions  Y(xs)=Ys
'(here Y may be single variable or vector of N variables).
'
'INPUT PARAMETERS:
'    Y       -   initial conditions, array[0..N-1].
'                contains values of Y[] at X[0]
'    N       -   system size
'    X       -   points at which Y should be tabulated, array[0..M-1]
'                integrations starts at X[0], ends at X[M-1],  intermediate
'                values at X[i] are returned too.
'                SHOULD BE ORDERED BY ASCENDING OR BY DESCENDING!!!!
'    M       -   number of intermediate points + first point + last point:
'                * M>2 means that you need both Y(X[M-1]) and M-2 values at
'                  intermediate points
'                * M=2 means that you want just to integrate from  X[0]  to
'                  X[1] and don't interested in intermediate values.
'                * M=1 means that you don't want to integrate :)
'                  it is degenerate case, but it will be handled correctly.
'                * M<1 means error
'    Eps     -   tolerance (absolute/relative error on each  step  will  be
'                less than Eps). When passing:
'                * Eps>0, it means desired ABSOLUTE error
'                * Eps<0, it means desired RELATIVE error.  Relative errors
'                  are calculated with respect to maximum values of  Y seen
'                  so far. Be careful to use this criterion  when  starting
'                  from Y[] that are close to zero.
'    H       -   initial  step  lenth,  it  will  be adjusted automatically
'                after the first  step.  If  H=0,  step  will  be  selected
'                automatically  (usualy  it  will  be  equal  to  0.001  of
'                min(x[i]-x[j])).
'
'OUTPUT PARAMETERS
'    State   -   structure which stores algorithm state between  subsequent
'                calls of OdeSolverIteration. Used for reverse communication.
'                This structure should be passed  to the OdeSolverIteration
'                subroutine.
